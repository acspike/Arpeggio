== Arpeggio ==
Arpeggio is a library for creating beautiful PDF scale and arpeggio diagrams. 
Arpeggio can generate documents using Reportlab (or Cairo, but the main focus 
has been on Reportlab). 


== Library ==

base_fb.py
    an abstract fretboard diagram. subclass BaseFB() to provide an 
    implmentation for a new cavas.
cairo_fb.py
    CairoFB() draws on a Cairo context
reportlab_fb.py
    ReportlabFB() draws on a Reportlab canvas
    FBFlowable() adapts ReportlabFB() to a Flowable() interface so that 
    fretboard diagrams can flow together with text in a document.

== Tools ==

fbdot.py 
    a simple graphical application for generating arrays of dots used to 
    generate diagrams. 
    (for example the arrays found in mode_arrays.py and arpeggio_arrays.py)

== Examples ==

example_0_reportlab.py
    generates a single fretboard on a page to show dots with rings and 
    various labels.
example_1_(cairo|reportlab).py
    generates a few pages of arpeggio diagrams.
example_2_cairo.py
    generates two pages of blank diagrams.
example_3_reportlab.py
    generates two documents one of modes and another of arpeggios. makes use of 
    reportlab's ability to flow text and drawings together in a document.
example_4_reportlab.py
    generates a set of fretboard memorization cards. print duplex flipping 
    on the short edge.
example_5_reportlab.py
    generates a few pages of diatonic major and minor scale patterns

== Other ==

notenames/
    a set of scripts to generate note memorization cards on the treble and 
    bass clefs. Range tuned to match guitar and bass both as written (8va) 
    and as sounded.
